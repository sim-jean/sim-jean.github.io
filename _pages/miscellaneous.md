On June 8th 2024, I'm giving several immersive conferences with the Festival [La Nuit des Forêts](https://nuitsdesforets.com/). Along this 45 minute walk in the Jardin d'Agronomie de la Ville de Paris, through diverse types of forest, I'll explain the sources and origins of wildfires, how they work, how forests evolve with it, their consequences on ecosystems and humans, and ways to adapt in the face of climate change (*in French*)

How much do wildfires cost? Is enough money spent for prevention and emergency relief? Do wildfires jeopardize economic sectors, including tourism? Are firefighters paid the right amount? 
Along with Simon Jean and Marc Riedel (voluntary firefighter and sociologist), Robin Lemoine explores the economic consequences of wildfires in the French economy.
