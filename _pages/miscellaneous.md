On June 8th 2024, I'm giving several immersive conferences with the Festival [La Nuit des Forêts](https://nuitsdesforets.com/). Along this 45 minute walk in the Jardin d'Agronomie de la Ville de Paris, through diverse types of forest, I'll explain the sources and origins of wildfires, how they work, how forests evolve with it, their consequences on ecosystems and humans, and ways to adapt in the face of climate change.
